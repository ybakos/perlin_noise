##Visualizing Perlin Noise

A [Processing](http://processing.org) sketch to illustrate how the [noise()](http://processing.org/reference/noise_.html) and [noiseDetail()](http://processing.org/reference/noiseDetail_.html) functions work.
This program lets the user print the generated values and also visualizes the effects of the number of octaves, the 'falloff' between octaves and the offset used to retrieve the noise value.
